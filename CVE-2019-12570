In "server status by hostname" plugin it is possible to inject arbitrary SQL queries when changing servers properties.
For this, an attacker should go to "All Servers" and click "Edit" on any of the servers. For instance,"id" parameter can be changed so the URI will look like this:
http://127.0.0.1/cve/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=all-servers&id=2+UNION+SELECT+1%2C2%2C3%2C%40%40version+&action=edit

This will trigger the DB to return DBMS version in the page body within the "IP/Hostname" field.
